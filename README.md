# nosleep.js

## Setup

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
- localhost:1234

## Ideas!

- full screen; no scrollbars - maybe have a disclaimer going off the edge of the page and user be unable to scroll to it?
- markee
- multiple pop ups
- unplesant color combinations; shifting colors
- things that look clickable, but aren't; random cursor changes
- slow answer load; loading bar that stalls and possibly errors
- "calculating possible dangers" with increasing denominator
- popups for personal info
- faux broken website - make it look like the user has damaged the service
- privacy policy/tos
- do not press back
- are you sure you want to leave?
- fake invalid input warning - first time user attempts to submit, tell them their input is invalid regardless of value
- "your daily 10 minutes of a man screaming"
- anxiety as a service?
